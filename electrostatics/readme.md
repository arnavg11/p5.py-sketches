this is a program that allows the user to create a situation of electrostatic charges on his own.
use the shift key to make the charge unmovable
use the keys 0-9 to give the charges the required charge(0=1unit, 9 = 10 unit)
use the keys q-p to give them mass(q = 2unit, p = 10 unit)
the default values are for charge, movability and mass are 0,True,1
NOTE: if clicked without pressing any key, a mass with charge 1 is made but if any key at all is pressed,the charge will be 0
